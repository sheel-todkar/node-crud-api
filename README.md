# Basic Node.js CRUD API (JSON-based)

This is a simple and beginner-friendly CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST API built with **Node.js** and **Express**, using an in-memory JSON object for data storage (via `db.js`). The project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture to maintain separation of concerns and keep the codebase organized.
